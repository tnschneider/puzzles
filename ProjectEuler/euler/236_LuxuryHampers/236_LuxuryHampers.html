   Although the suppliers try very hard to ship their goods in perfect condition, there is inevitably some spoilage -
   <i>
    i.e.
   </i>
   products gone bad.
  </p>
  <p>
   The suppliers compare their performance using two types of statistic:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The five
    <i>
     per-product spoilage rates
    </i>
    for each supplier are equal to the number of products gone bad divided by the number of products supplied, for each of the five products in turn.
   </li>
   <li>
    The
    <i>
     overall spoilage rate
    </i>
    for each supplier is equal to the total number of products gone bad divided by the total number of products provided by that supplier.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   To their surprise, the suppliers found that each of the five per-product spoilage rates was worse (higher) for 'B' than for 'A' by the same factor (ratio of spoilage rates),
   <var>
    m
   </var>
   &gt;1; and yet, paradoxically, the overall spoilage rate was worse for 'A' than for 'B', also by a factor of
   <var>
    m
   </var>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   There are thirty-five
   <var>
    m
   </var>
   &gt;1 for which this surprising result could have occurred, the smallest of which is 1476/1475.
  </p>
  <p>
   What's the largest possible value of
   <var>
    m
   </var>
   ?
   <br/>
   Give your answer as a fraction reduced to its lowest terms, in the form
   <var>
    u
   </var>
   /
   <var>
    v
