   A game is played with two piles of stones and two players. At her turn, a player removes a number of stones from the larger pile. The number of stones she removes must be a positive multiple of the number of stones in the smaller pile.
  </p>
  <p>
   E.g., let the ordered pair(6,14) describe a configuration with 6 stones in the smaller pile and 14 stones in the larger pile, then the first player can remove 6 or 12 stones from the larger pile.
  </p>
  <p>
   The player taking all the stones from a pile wins the game.
  </p>
  <p>
   A
   <i>
    winning configuration
   </i>
   is one where the first player can force a win. For example, (1,5), (2,6) and (3,12) are winning configurations because the first player can immediately remove all stones in the second pile.
  </p>
  <p>
   A
   <i>
    losing configuration
   </i>
   is one where the second player can force a win, no matter what the first player does. For example, (2,3) and (3,4) are losing configurations: any legal move leaves a winning configuration for the second player.
