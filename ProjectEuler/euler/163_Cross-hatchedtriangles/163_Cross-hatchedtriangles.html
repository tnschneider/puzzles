   Consider an equilateral triangle in which straight lines are drawn from each vertex to the middle of the opposite side, such as in the
   <i>
    size 1
   </i>
   triangle in the sketch below.

   Sixteen triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or location can now be observed in that triangle. Using
   <i>
    size 1
   </i>
   triangles as building blocks, larger triangles can be formed, such as the
   <i>
    size 2
   </i>
   triangle in the above sketch. One-hundred and four triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or location can now be observed in that
   <i>
    size 2
   </i>
   triangle.
  </p>
  <p>
   It can be observed that the
   <i>
    size 2
   </i>
   triangle contains 4
   <i>
    size 1
   </i>
   triangle building blocks. A
   <i>
    size 3
   </i>
   triangle would contain 9
   <i>
    size 1
   </i>
   triangle building blocks and a
   <i>
    size n
   </i>
   triangle would thus contain
   <i>
    n
    <sup>
     2
    </sup>
    size 1
   </i>
   triangle building blocks.
  </p>
  <p>
   If we denote T(
   <var>
    n
   </var>
   ) as the number of triangles present in a triangle of
   <i>
    size
    <var>
     n
    </var>
   </i>
   , then
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left:50px;">
   T(1) = 16
   <br/>
   T(2) = 104
  </p>
  <p>
   Find T(36).
