   A positive integer will be called
   <i>
    reachable
   </i>
   if it can result from an arithmetic expression obeying the following rules:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Uses the digits 1 through 9, in that order and exactly once each.
   </li>
   <li>
    Any successive digits can be concatenated (for example, using the digits 2, 3 and 4 we obtain the number 234).
   </li>
   <li>
    Only the four usual binary arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) are allowed.
   </li>
   <li>
    Each operation can be used any number of times, or not at all.
   </li>
   <li>
    <dfn title="A minus sign applied to a single operand (as opposed to a subtraction operator between two operands)">
     Unary minus
    </dfn>
    is not allowed.
   </li>
   <li>
    Any number of (possibly nested) parentheses may be used to define the order of operations.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   For example, 42 is reachable, since (1/23) * ((4*5)-6) * (78-9) = 42.
  </p>
  <p>
   What is the sum of all positive reachable integers?
