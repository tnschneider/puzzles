   Let (
   <i>
    a
   </i>
   ,
   <i>
    b
   </i>
   ,
   <i>
    c
   </i>
   ) represent the three sides of a right angle triangle with integral length sides. It is possible to place four such triangles together to form a square with length
   <i>
    c
   </i>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   For example, (3, 4, 5) triangles can be placed together to form a 5 by 5 square with a 1 by 1 hole in the middle and it can be seen that the 5 by 5 square can be tiled with twenty-five 1 by 1 squares.
  </p>
  <div style="text-align:center;">

  </div>
  <p>
   However, if (5, 12, 13) triangles were used then the hole would measure 7 by 7 and these could not be used to tile the 13 by 13 square.
  </p>
  <p>
   Given that the perimeter of the right triangle is less than one-hundred million, how many Pythagorean triangles would allow such a tiling to take place?
