   The flipping game is a two player game played on a N by N square board.
   <br/>
   Each square contains a disk with one side white and one side black.
   <br/>
   The game starts with all disks showing their white side.
  </p>
  <p>
   A turn consists of flipping all disks in a rectangle with the following properties:
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    the upper right corner of the rectangle contains a white disk
   </li>
   <li>
    the rectangle width is a perfect square (1, 4, 9, 16, ...)
   </li>
   <li>
    the rectangle height is a

   Let W(N) be the number of

   W(1) = 1, W(2) = 0, W(5) = 8 and W(10

   ) = 31395.
