  <p>
   A gambler decides to participate in a special lottery. In this lottery the gambler plays a series of one or more games.
   <br/>
   Each game costs
   <var>
    m
   </var>
   pounds to play and starts with an initial pot of 1 pound. The gambler flips an unbiased coin. Every time a head appears, the pot is doubled and the gambler continues. When a tail appears, the game ends and the gambler collects the current value of the pot. The gambler is certain to win at least 1 pound, the starting value of the pot, at the cost of
   <var>
    m
   </var>
   pounds, the initial fee.
  </p>
  <p>
   The gambler cannot continue to play if his fortune falls below
   <var>
    m
   </var>
   pounds.
Let
   <var>
    p
    <sub>
     m
    </sub>
   </var>
   (
   <var>
    s
   </var>
   ) denote the probability that the gambler will never run out of money in this lottery given his initial fortune
   <var>
    s
   </var>
   and the cost per game
   <var>
    m
   </var>
   .
   <br/>
   For example
   <var>
    p
   </var>
   <sub>
    2
   </sub>
   (2) ≈ 0.2522,
   <var>
    p
   </var>
   <sub>
    2
   </sub>
   (5) ≈ 0.6873 and
   <var>
    p
   </var>
   <sub>

   </sub>
   (10 000) ≈ 0.9952 (note:
   <var>
    p
    <sub>

   </var>
   (
   <var>
    s

   ) = 0 for
   <var>
    s
   </var>
   &lt;
