   The
   <b>
    harmonic series
   </b>
   $1 + \dfrac{1}{2} + \dfrac{1}{3} + \dfrac{1}{4} + ...$ is well known to be divergent.
  </p>
  <p>
   If we however omit from this series every term where the denominator has a 9 in it, the series remarkably enough converges to approximately 22.9206766193.
   <br/>
   This modified harmonic series is called the
   <b>
    Kempner
   </b>
   series.
  </p>
  <p>
   Let us now consider another modified harmonic series by omitting from the harmonic series every term where the denominator has 3 or more equal consecutive digits.
One can verify that out of the first 1200 terms of the harmonic series, only 20 terms will be omitted.
   <br/>
   These 20 omitted terms are:
  </p>
  <p>
   $$\dfrac{1}{111}, \dfrac{1}{222}, \dfrac{1}{333}, \dfrac{1}{444}, \dfrac{1}{555}, \dfrac{1}{666}, \dfrac{1}{777}, \dfrac{1}{888}, \dfrac{1}{999}, \dfrac{1}{1000}, \dfrac{1}{1110}, \\\ \dfrac{1}{1111}, \dfrac{1}{1112}, \dfrac{1}{1113}, \dfrac{1}{1114}, \dfrac{1}{1115}, \dfrac{1}{1116}, \dfrac{1}{1117}, \dfrac{1}{1118}, \dfrac{1}{1119}$$
  </p>
  <p>
   This series converges as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   Find the value the series converges to.
   <br/>
   Give your answer rounded to 10 digits behind the decimal point.
