   There are several ways to write the number 1/2 as a sum of inverse squares using
   <i>
    distinct
   </i>
   integers.
  </p>
  <p>
   For instance, the numbers {2,3,4,5,7,12,15,20,28,35} can be used:

  </p>
  <p>
   In fact, only using integers between 2 and 45 inclusive, there are exactly three ways to do it, the remaining two being: {2,3,4,6,7,9,10,20,28,35,36,45} and {2,3,4,6,7,9,12,15,28,30,35,36,45}.
  </p>
  <p>
   How many ways are there to write the number 1/2 as a sum of inverse squares using distinct integers between 2 and 80 inclusive?
