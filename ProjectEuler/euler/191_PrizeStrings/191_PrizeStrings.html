   A particular school offers cash rewards to children with good attendance and punctuality. If they are absent for three consecutive days or late on more than one occasion then they forfeit their prize.
  </p>
  <p>
   During an n-day period a trinary string is formed for each child consisting of L's (late), O's (on time), and A's (absent).

   AALO AALA ALOO ALOA ALAO ALAA LOOO LOOA LOAO LOAA
