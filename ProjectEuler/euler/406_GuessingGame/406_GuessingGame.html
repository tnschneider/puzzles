  <p>
   We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers {1, 2, ...,
   <var>
    n
   </var>
   } by asking questions. 
Each number (question) we ask, we get one of three possible answers:
   <br/>
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    "Your guess is lower than the hidden number" (and you incur a cost of
    <var>
     a
    </var>
    ), or
   </li>
   <li>
    "Your guess is higher than the hidden number" (and you incur a cost of
    <var>
     b
    </var>
    ), or
   </li>
   <li>
    "Yes, that's it!" (and the game ends).
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Given the value of
   <var>
    n
   </var>
   ,
   <var>
    a
   </var>
   , and
   <var>
    b
   </var>
   , an
   <i>
    optimal strategy
   </i>
   minimizes the total cost
   <u>
    for the worst possible case
   </u>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   For example, if
   <var>
    n
   </var>
   = 5,
   <var>
    a
   </var>
   = 2, and
   <var>
    b
   </var>
   = 3, then we may begin by asking "
   <b>
    2
   </b>
   " as our first question.
  </p>
  <p>
   If we are told that 2 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of
   <var>
    b
   </var>
   =3), then we are sure that "
   <b>
    1
   </b>
   " is the hidden number (for a total cost of
   <span style="color:#0000FF;">
    <b>
     3
    </b>
   </span>
   ).
   <br/>
   If we are told that 2 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of
   <var>
    a
   </var>
   =2), then our next question will be "
   <b>
    4
   </b>
   ".
   <br/>
   If we are told that 4 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of
   <var>
    b
   </var>
   =3), then we are sure that "
   <b>
    3
   </b>
   " is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+3=
   <span style="color:#0000FF;">
    <b>
     5
    </b>
   </span>
   ).
   <br/>
   If we are told that 4 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of
   <var>
    a
   </var>
   =2), then we are sure that "
   <b>
    5
   </b>
   " is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+2=
   <span style="color:#0000FF;">
    <b>
     4
    </b>
   </span>
   ).
   <br/>
   Thus, the worst-case cost achieved by this strategy is
   <span style="color:#FF0000;">
    <b>
     5
    </b>
   </span>
   . It can also be shown that this is the lowest worst-case cost that can be achieved. 
So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for the given values of
   <var>
    n
   </var>
   ,
   <var>
    a
   </var>
   , and
   <var>
    b
   </var>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Let C(
   <var>
    n
   </var>
   ,
   <var>
    a
   </var>
   ,
   <var>
    b
   </var>
   ) be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for the given values of
   <var>
    n
   </var>
   ,
   <var>
    a
   </var>
   , and
   <var>
    b
   </var>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Here are a few examples:
   <br/>
   C(5, 2, 3) = 5
   <br/>
   C(500, √2, √3) = 13.22073197...
   <br/>
   C(20000, 5, 7) = 82
   <br/>
   C(2000000, √5, √7) = 49.63755955...
  </p>
  <p>
   Let F
   <sub>
    <var>
     k
    </var>
   </sub>
   be the Fibonacci numbers: F
   <sub>
    <var>
     k
    </var>
   </sub>
   = F
   <sub>
    <var>
     k
    </var>
    -1
   </sub>
   + F
   <sub>
    <var>
     k
    </var>
    -2
   </sub>
   with base cases F
   <sub>
    1
   </sub>
   = F
   <sub>
    2
   </sub>
   = 1.
   <br/>
   Find ∑
   <sub>
    1≤
    <var>
     k
    </var>
    ≤30
   </sub>
   C(10
   <sup>
    12
   </sup>
   , √
   <var>
    k
   </var>
   , √F
   <sub>
    <var>
     k
    </var>
   </sub>
   ), and give your answer rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.
