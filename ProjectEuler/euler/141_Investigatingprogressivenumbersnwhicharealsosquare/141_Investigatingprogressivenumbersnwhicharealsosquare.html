  <p>
   A positive integer,
   <i>
    n
   </i>
   , is divided by
   <i>
    d
   </i>
   and the quotient and remainder are
   <i>
    q
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    r
   </i>
   respectively. In addition
   <i>
    d
   </i>
   ,
   <i>
    q
   </i>
   , and
   <i>
    r
   </i>
   are consecutive positive integer terms in a geometric sequence, but not necessarily in that order.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example, 58 divided by 6 has quotient 9 and remainder 4. It can also be seen that 4, 6, 9 are consecutive terms in a geometric sequence (common ratio 3/2).
   <br/>
   We will call such numbers,
   <i>
    n
   </i>
   , progressive.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some progressive numbers, such as 9 and 10404 = 102
   <sup>
    2
   </sup>
   , happen to also be perfect squares.
   <br/>
   The sum of all progressive perfect squares below one hundred thousand is 124657.
  </p>
  <p>
   Find the sum of all progressive perfect squares below one trillion (10
   <sup>
    12
   </sup>
   ).
