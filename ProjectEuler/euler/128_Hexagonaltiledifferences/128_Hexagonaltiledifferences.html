   A hexagonal tile with number 1 is surrounded by a ring of six hexagonal tiles, starting at "12 o'clock" and numbering the tiles 2 to 7 in an anti-clockwise direction.
  </p>
  <p>
   New rings are added in the same fashion, with the next rings being numbered 8 to 19, 20 to 37, 38 to 61, and so on. The diagram below shows the first three rings.

   By finding the difference between tile
   <i>
    n
   </i>
   and each of its six neighbours we shall define PD(
   <i>
    n
   </i>
   ) to be the number of those differences which are prime.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example, working clockwise around tile 8 the differences are 12, 29, 11, 6, 1, and 13. So PD(8) = 3.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the same way, the differences around tile 17 are 1, 17, 16, 1, 11, and 10, hence PD(17) = 2.
  </p>
  <p>
   It can be shown that the maximum value of PD(
   <i>
    n
   </i>
   ) is 3.
  </p>
  <p>
   If all of the tiles for which PD(
   <i>
    n
   </i>
   ) = 3 are listed in ascending order to form a sequence, the 10th tile would be 271.
  </p>
  <p>
   Find the 2000th tile in this sequence.
