   Consider the following set of dice with nonstandard pips:
  </p>
  <p>
   Die A: 1 4 4 4 4 4
   <br/>
   Die B: 2 2 2 5 5 5
   <br/>
   Die C: 3 3 3 3 3 6
   <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
   A game is played by two players picking a die in turn and rolling it. The player who rolls the highest value wins.
  </p>
  <p>
   If the first player picks die A and the second player picks die B we get
   <br/>
   P(second player wins) =
   <sup>
    7
   </sup>
   /
   <sub>
    12
   </sub>
   &gt;
   <sup>
    1
   </sup>
   /
   <sub>
    2
   </sub>
  </p>
  <p>
   If the first player picks die B and the second player picks die C we get
   <br/>
   P(second player wins) =
   <sup>
    7
   </sup>
   /
   <sub>
    12
   </sub>
   &gt;
   <sup>
    1
   </sup>
   /
   <sub>
    2
   </sub>
  </p>
  <p>
   If the first player picks die C and the second player picks die A we get
   <br/>
   P(second player wins) =
   <sup>
    25
   </sup>
   /
   <sub>
    36
   </sub>
   &gt;
   <sup>
    1
   </sup>
   /
   <sub>
    2
   </sub>
  </p>
  <p>
   So whatever die the first player picks, the second player can pick another die and have a larger than 50% chance of winning.

   A set of dice having this property is called a
   <b>
    nontransitive set of dice
   </b>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   We wish to investigate how many sets of nontransitive dice exist. We will assume the following conditions:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    There are three six-sided dice with each side having between 1 and
    <var>
     N
    </var>
    pips, inclusive.
   </li>
   <li>
    Dice with the same set of pips are equal, regardless of which side on the die the pips are located.
   </li>
   <li>
    The same pip value may appear on multiple dice; if both players roll the same value neither player wins.
   </li>
   <li>
    The sets of dice {A,B,C}, {B,C,A} and {C,A,B} are the same set.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   For
   <var>
    N
   </var>
   = 7 we find there are 9780 such sets.
   <br/>
   How many are there for
   <var>
    N
   </var>
   = 30 ?
