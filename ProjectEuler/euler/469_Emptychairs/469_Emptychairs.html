  <p>
   In a room
   <var>
    N
   </var>
   chairs are placed around a round table.
   <br/>
   Knights enter the room one by one and choose at random an available empty chair.
   <br/>
   To have enough elbow room the knights always leave at least one empty chair between each other.
  </p>
  <p>
   When there aren't any suitable chairs left, the fraction
   <var>
    C
   </var>
   of empty chairs is determined.
   <br/>
   We also define E(
   <var>
    N
   </var>
   ) as the expected value of
   <var>
    C
   </var>
   .
   <br/>
   We can verify that E(4) = 1/2 and E(6) = 5/9.
  </p>
  <p>
   Find E(10
   <sup>
    18
   </sup>
   ). Give your answer rounded to fourteen decimal places in the form 0.abcdefghijklmn.
