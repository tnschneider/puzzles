   A firecracker explodes at a height of 100 m above level ground. It breaks into a large number of very small fragments, which move in every direction; all of them have the same initial velocity of 20 m/s.
  </p>
  <p>
   We assume that the fragments move without air resistance, in a uniform gravitational field with g=9.81 m/s
   <sup>
    2
   </sup>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Find the volume (in m
   <sup>
    3
   </sup>
   ) of the region through which the fragments move before reaching the ground. 
Give your answer rounded to four decimal places.
