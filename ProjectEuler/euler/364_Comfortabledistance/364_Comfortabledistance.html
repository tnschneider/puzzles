  <p>
   There are
   <var>
    N
   </var>
   seats in a row.
   <var>
    N
   </var>
   people come after each other to fill the seats according to the following rules:
  </p>
  <ol type="1">
   <li>
    If there is any seat whose adjacent seat(s) are not occupied take such a seat.
   </li>
   <li>
    If there is no such seat and there is any seat for which only one adjacent seat is occupied take such a seat.
   </li>
   <li>
    Otherwise take one of the remaining available seats.
   </li>
  </ol>
  Let T(
  <var>
   N
  </var>
  ) be the number of possibilities that
  <var>
   N
  </var>
  seats are occupied by
  <var>
   N
  </var>
  people with the given rules.
  <br/>
  The following figure shows T(4)=8.
  <div align="center">
   <img alt="p364_comf_dist.gif" src="project/images/p364_comf_dist.gif"/>
  </div>
  <p>
   We can verify that T(10) = 61632 and T(1 000) mod 100 000 007 = 47255094.
  </p>
  <p>
   Find T(1 000 000) mod 100 000 007.
