  <p>
   For two positive integers a and b, the Ulam sequence U(a,b) is defined by U(a,b)
   <sub>
    1
   </sub>
   = a, U(a,b)
   <sub>
    2
   </sub>
   = b and for k &gt; 2,
U(a,b)
   <sub>
    k
   </sub>
   is the smallest integer greater than U(a,b)
   <sub>
    (k-1)
   </sub>
   which can be written in exactly one way as the sum of two distinct previous members of U(a,b).
  </p>
  <p>
   For example, the sequence U(1,2) begins with
   <br/>
   1, 2, 3 = 1 + 2, 4 = 1 + 3, 6 = 2 + 4, 8 = 2 + 6, 11 = 3 + 8;
   <br/>
   5 does not belong to it because 5 = 1 + 4 = 2 + 3 has two representations as the sum of two previous members, likewise 7 = 1 + 6 = 3 + 4.
