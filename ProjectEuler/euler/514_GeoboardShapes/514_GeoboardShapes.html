   A
   <b>
    geoboard
   </b>
   (of order
   <var>
    N
   </var>
   ) is a square board with equally-spaced pins protruding from the surface, representing an integer point lattice for coordinates 0 ≤
   <var>
    x
   </var>
   ,
   <var>
    y
   </var>
   ≤
   <var>

   John begins with a pinless geoboard. Each position on the board is a hole that can be filled with a pin. John decides to generate a random integer between 1 and
   <var>
    N
   </var>
   +1 (inclusive) for each hole in the geoboard. If the random integer is equal to 1 for a given hole, then a pin is placed in that hole.
  </p>
  <p>
   After John is finished generating numbers for all (
   <var>
    N
   </var>
   +1)
   <sup>
    2
   </sup>
   holes and placing any/all corresponding pins, he wraps a tight rubberband around the entire group of pins protruding from the board. Let
   <var>
    S
   </var>
   represent the shape that is formed.
   <var>
    S
   </var>
   can also be defined as the smallest convex shape that contains all the pins.

   The above image depicts a sample layout for
   <var>
    N
   </var>
   = 4. The green markers indicate positions where pins have been placed, and the blue lines collectively represent the rubberband. For this particular arrangement,
   <var>
    S
   </var>
   has an area of 6. If there are fewer than three pins on the board (or if all pins are collinear),
   <var>
    S
   </var>
   can be assumed to have zero area.
  </p>
  <p>
   Let E(
   <var>
    N
   </var>
   ) be the expected area of
   <var>
    S
   </var>
   given a geoboard of order
   <var>
    N
   </var>
   . For example, E(1) = 0.18750, E(2) = 0.94335, and E(10) = 55.03013 when rounded to five decimal places each.
  </p>
  <p>
   Calculate E(100) rounded to five decimal places.
