   <i>
    The Chase
   </i>
   " is a game played with two dice and an even number of players.
  </p>
  <p>
   The players sit around a table; the game begins with two opposite players having one die each. On each turn, the two players with a die roll it.
   <br/>
   If a player rolls a 1, he passes the die to his neighbour on the left; if he rolls a 6, he passes the die to his neighbour on the right; otherwise, he keeps the die for the next turn.
   <br/>
   The game ends when one player has both dice after they have been rolled and passed; that player has then lost.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a game with 100 players, what is the expected number of turns the game lasts?
  </p>
  <p>
   Give your answer rounded to ten significant digits.
