   A square piece of paper with integer dimensions N×N is placed with a corner at the origin and two of its sides along the
   <var>
    x
   </var>
   - and
   <var>
    y
   </var>
   -axes. Then, we cut it up respecting the following rules:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    We only make straight cuts between two points lying on different sides of the square, and having integer coordinates.
   </li>
   <li>
    Two cuts cannot cross, but several cuts can meet at the same border point.
   </li>
   <li>
    Proceed until no more legal cuts can be made.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Counting any reflections or rotations as distinct, we call C(N) the number of ways to cut an N×N square. For example, C(1) = 2 and C(2) = 30 (shown below).
