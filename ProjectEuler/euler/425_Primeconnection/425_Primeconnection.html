   Two positive numbers A and B are said to be
   <i>
    connected
   </i>
   (denoted by "A ↔ B") if one of these conditions holds:
   <br/>
   (1) A and B have the same length and differ in exactly one digit; for example, 123 ↔ 173.
   <br/>
   (2) Adding one digit to the left of A (or B) makes B (or A); for example, 23 ↔ 223 and 123 ↔ 23.
  </p>
  <p>
   We call a prime P a
   <i>
    2's relative
   </i>
   if there exists a chain of connected primes between 2 and P and no prime in the chain exceeds P.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example, 127 is a 2's relative. One of the possible chains is shown below:
   <br/>
   2 ↔ 3 ↔ 13 ↔ 113 ↔ 103 ↔ 107 ↔ 127
   <br/>
   However, 11 and 103 are not 2's relatives.
  </p>
  <p>
   Let F(N) be the sum of the primes ≤ N which are not 2's relatives.
   <br/>
   We can verify that F(10
   <sup>
    3
   </sup>
   ) = 431 and F(10
   <sup>
    4
   </sup>
   ) = 78728.
  </p>
  <p>
   Find F(10
   <sup>
    7
   </sup>
   ).
