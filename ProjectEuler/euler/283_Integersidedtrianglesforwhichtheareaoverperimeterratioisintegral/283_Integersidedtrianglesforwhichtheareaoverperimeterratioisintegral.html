   Consider the triangle with sides 6, 8 and 10. It can be seen that the perimeter and the area are both equal to 24. 
So the area/perimeter ratio is equal to 1.
   <br/>
   Consider also the triangle with sides 13, 14 and 15. The perimeter equals 42 while the area is equal to 84. 
So for this triangle the area/perimeter ratio is equal to 2.

  <p>
   Find the sum of the perimeters of all integer sided triangles for which the area/perimeter ratios are equal to positive integers not exceeding 1000.
