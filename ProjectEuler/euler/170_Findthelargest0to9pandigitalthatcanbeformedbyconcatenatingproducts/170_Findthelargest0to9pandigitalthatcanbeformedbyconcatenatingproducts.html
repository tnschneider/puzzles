   Take the number 6 and multiply it by each of 1273 and 9854:
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left:50px;">
   6 × 1273 =  7638
   <br/>
   6 × 9854 = 59124
  </p>
  <p>
   By concatenating these products we get the 1 to 9 pandigital 763859124. We will call 763859124 the "concatenated product of 6 and (1273,9854)". Notice too, that the concatenation of the input numbers, 612739854, is also 1 to 9 pandigital.
  </p>
  <p>
   The same can be done for 0 to 9 pandigital numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
   What is the largest 0 to 9 pandigital 10-digit concatenated product of an integer with two or more other integers, such that the concatenation of the input numbers is also a 0 to 9 pandigital 10-digit number?
