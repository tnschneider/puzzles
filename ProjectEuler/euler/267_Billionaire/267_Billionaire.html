   You are given a unique investment opportunity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Starting with £1 of capital, you can choose a fixed proportion,
   <var>
    f
   </var>
   , of your capital to bet on a fair coin toss repeatedly for 1000 tosses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Your return is double your bet for heads and you lose your bet for tails.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example, if
   <var>
    f
   </var>
   = 1/4,  for the first toss you bet £0.25, and if heads comes up you win £0.5 and so then have £1.5. You then bet £0.375 and if the second toss is tails, you have £1.125.
  </p>
  <p>
   Choosing
   <var>
    f
   </var>
   to maximize your chances of having at least £1,000,000,000 after 1,000 flips, what is the chance that you become a billionaire?
