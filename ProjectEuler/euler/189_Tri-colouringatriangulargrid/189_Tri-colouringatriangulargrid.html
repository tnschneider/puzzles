   Consider the following configuration of 64 triangles:
  </p>
  <div style="text-align:center;">
   <img alt="" src="project/images/p189_grid.gif"/>
  </div>
  <p>
   We wish to colour the interior of each triangle with one of three colours: red, green or blue, so that no two neighbouring triangles have the same colour. Such a colouring shall be called valid. Here, two triangles are said to be neighbouring if they share an edge.
   <br/>
   Note: if they only share a vertex, then they are not neighbours.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example, here is a valid colouring of the above grid:
  </p>
  <div style="text-align:center;">
   <img alt="" src="project/images/p189_colours.gif"/>
  </div>
  <p>
   A colouring C' which is obtained from a colouring C by rotation or reflection is considered
   <i>
    distinct
   </i>
   from C unless the two are identical.
  </p>
  <p>
   How many distinct valid colourings are there for the above configuration?
