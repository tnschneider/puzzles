   Barbara is a mathematician and a basketball player. She has found that the probability of scoring a point when shooting from a distance
   <var>
    x
   </var>
   is exactly (1 -
   <sup>
    <var>
     x
    </var>
   </sup>
   /
   <sub>
    <var>
     q
    </var>
   </sub>
   ), where
   <var>
    q
   </var>
   is a real constant greater than 50.
  </p>
  <p>
   During each practice run, she takes shots from distances
   <var>
    x
   </var>
   = 1,
   <var>
    x
   </var>
   = 2, ...,
   <var>
    x
   </var>
   = 50 and, according to her records, she has precisely a 2 % chance to score a total of exactly 20 points.
  </p>
  <p>
   Find
   <var>
    q
   </var>
   and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.
