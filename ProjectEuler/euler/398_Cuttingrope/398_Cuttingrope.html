  <p>
   Inside a rope of length
   <var>
    n
   </var>
   ,
   <var>
    n
   </var>
   -1 points are placed with distance 1 from each other and from the endpoints. Among these points, we choose
   <var>
    m
   </var>
   -1 points at random and cut the rope at these points to create
   <var>
    m
   </var>
   segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Let E(
   <var>
    n
   </var>
   ,
   <var>
    m
   </var>
   ) be the expected length of the second-shortest segment.
For example, E(3, 2) = 2 and E(8, 3) = 16/7.
Note that if multiple segments have the same shortest length the length of the second-shortest segment is defined as the same as the shortest length.
  </p>
  <p>
   Find E(10
   <sup>
    7
   </sup>
   , 100).
Give your answer rounded to 5 decimal places behind the decimal point.
