  <p>
   A horizontal row comprising of 2
   <var>
    n
   </var>
   + 1 squares has
   <var>
    n
   </var>
   red counters placed at one end and
   <var>
    n
   </var>
   blue counters at the other end, being separated by a single empty square in the centre. For example, when
   <var>
    n
   </var>
   = 3.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <div align="center">
   <img alt="p321_swapping_counters_1.gif" src="project/images/p321_swapping_counters_1.gif"/>
  </div>
  <p>
   A counter can move from one square to the next (slide) or can jump over another counter (hop) as long as the square next to that counter is unoccupied.
  </p>
  <p>

  </div>
  <p>
   Let M(
   <var>
    n
   </var>
   ) represent the minimum number of moves/actions to completely reverse the positions of the coloured counters; that is, move all the red counters to the right and all the blue counters to the left.
  </p>
  <p>
   It can be verified M(3) = 15, which also happens to be a triangle number.
  </p>
  <p>
   If we create a sequence based on the values of
   <var>
    n
   </var>
   for which M(
   <var>
    n
   </var>
   ) is a triangle number then the first five terms would be:
   <br/>
   1, 3, 10, 22, and 63, and their sum would be 99.
  </p>
  <p>
   Find the sum of the first forty terms of this sequence.
