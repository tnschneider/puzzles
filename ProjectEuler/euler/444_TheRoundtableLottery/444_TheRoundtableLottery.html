  <p>
   A group of
   <var>
    p
   </var>
   people decide to sit down at a round table and play a lottery-ticket trading game. Each person starts off with a randomly-assigned, unscratched lottery ticket. Each ticket, when scratched, reveals a whole-pound prize ranging anywhere from £1 to £
   <var>
    p
   </var>
   , with no two tickets alike. The goal of the game is for each person to maximize his ticket winnings upon leaving the game.
  </p>
  <p>
   An arbitrary person is chosen to be the first player. Going around the table, each player has only one of two options:
  </p>
  <p>
   1. The player can scratch his ticket and reveal its worth to everyone at the table.
   <br/>
   2. The player can trade his unscratched ticket for a previous player's scratched ticket, and then leave the game with that ticket. The previous player then scratches his newly-acquired ticket and reveals its worth to everyone at the table.
  </p>
  <p>
   The game ends once all tickets have been scratched. All players still remaining at the table must leave with their currently-held tickets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Assume that each player uses the optimal strategy for maximizing the expected value of his ticket winnings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Let E(
   <var>
    p
   </var>
   ) represent the expected number of players left at the table when the game ends in a game consisting of
   <var>
    p
   </var>
   players (e.g. E(111) = 5.2912 when rounded to 5 significant digits).

   Let S

   <var>

  <p>
   Find S
   <sub>

   </sub>
   (10

   </sup>
   ) and write the answer in scientific notation rounded to 10 significant digits. Use a lowercase e to separate mantissa and exponent (e.g. S
   <sub>
    3
   </sub>
   (100) = 5.983679014e5).
