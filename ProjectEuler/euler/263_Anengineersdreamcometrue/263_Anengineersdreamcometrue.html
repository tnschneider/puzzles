   Consider the number 6. The divisors of 6 are: 1,2,3 and 6.
   <br/>
   Every number from 1 up to and including 6 can be written as a sum of distinct divisors of 6:
   <br/>
   1=1, 2=2, 3=1+2, 4=1+3, 5=2+3, 6=6.
   <br/>
   A number
   <var>
    n
   </var>
   is called a practical number if every number from 1 up to and including
   <var>
    n
   </var>
   can be expressed as a sum of distinct divisors of
   <var>
    n
   </var>
   .

   A pair of consecutive prime numbers with a difference of six is called a sexy pair (since "sex" is the Latin word for "six"). The first sexy pair is (23, 29).
  </p>
  <p>
   We may occasionally find a triple-pair, which means three consecutive sexy prime pairs, such that the second member of each pair is the first member of the next pair.
  </p>
  <p>
   We shall call a number
   <var>
    n
   </var>
   such that :
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    (
    <var>
     n
    </var>
    -9,
    <var>
     n
    </var>
    -3), (
    <var>
     n
    </var>
    -3,
    <var>
     n
    </var>
    +3), (
    <var>
     n
    </var>
    +3,
    <var>
     n
    </var>
    +9) form a triple-pair, and
   </li>
   <li>
    the numbers
    <var>
     n
    </var>
    -8,
    <var>
     n
    </var>
    -4,
    <var>
     n
    </var>
    ,
    <var>
     n
    </var>
    +4 and
    <var>
     n
    </var>
    +8 are all practical,
   </li>
  </ul>
